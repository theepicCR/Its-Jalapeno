# What is It's Jalapeno?
It's Jalapeno? is a fun, interactive guessing game surrounded around a grey little cat named Jalapeno. Inspired by the "Who's that Pokemon?" meme, objective of the game is to guess
the names of all 10 randomized Jalapeno-nized creatures or items based on its silhouette using this formula: 

### **Name = Jalapeno + Creature/Item Silhouette**

This is obviously not an easy task - so hints are there to help you! However, if you were unable to guess the Jalapeno-mashup correctly - that's okay!
The game will provide the name of each Jalapeno if you guessed it correctly or ran out of guesses. You can remember these names for the next games, just in case that same Jalapeno-nized 
creature decides to show up again!

You can play this game as many times as you want for how long you want - there's no time limit! The goal of this game is to guess them correctly, and more importantly: have fun!
